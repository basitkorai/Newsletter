## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [SASS/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) - CSS with superpower
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned
- As the ```<h1>...</h1>``` is must for every html page I added the ```<h1>...</h1>``` element which only will be visible to the screenreaders in this case.

- For the Email Verification, I've disabled the built-in HTML validation and achieved it with JS by using regex and test() method.

### Continued development

- I'd love to explore Javascript frameworks more, along with honing my HTML and CSS Skills with further libraries and frameworks. üòä

### Useful resources

- [Coder Coder's Sass Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfMHA8SqUL4&ab_channel=CoderCoder) - It helped me with [SASS](https://sass-lang.com) and [BEM](https://getbem.com/). I really loved this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Brad Traversy's Grid Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xMQfnTU6oo&ab_channel=TraversyMedia) - This is an amazing video that helped me finally understand [CSS GRID](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout). I'd recommend it to anyone still learning [GRID](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout).
